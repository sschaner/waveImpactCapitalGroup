  <div class="container">
    <p>
      Many people, even those who appear well off, worry about their financial
      future. How we think about, earn, spend, save, invest, and feel when it
      comes to money is often hardwired into us before we reach adulthood.
      Through education and a focused shift in your ideas and handling of money,
      you can learn and mirror what the top 1% know and do to reach financial
      freedom.
    </p>

    <p>
      Wave Impact Capital Group's goal is to be a resource to as many people as
      possible on their journey to financial freedom. We strive to provide
      valuable information on the mindset and practices of the wealthy. Then,
      when you are ready, we offer investing opportunities practiced by the
      wealthy that can bring you financial freedom.

          My love for real estate investing was born when I read
          <em>Rich Dad, Poor Dad</em> by Robert Kiyosaki as a teen. I then went
          on to earn a degree in Personal Financial Planning from the best
          finance program in the country. Since then, I have constantly sought
          education in the mindset and practice of the investor with a focus on
          multifamily. Wave Impact Capial Group is the second real estate
          investor company I have created, with the first currently earning 36%
          profits on many of its assets.
